1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Web Portal Documentation (WPD) is to comprehensively outline the
development and functionality of the web portal project aimed at addressing the inefficiencies
and complexities associated with the current method of sharing Google Drive (GD)
resources. The WPD encompasses the System Requirements Specification (SRS), System
Design Document (SDD), and System Testing Document (STD), providing a detailed
roadmap for developers, testers, project managers, and end-users.
Our project seeks to revolutionize the way users interact with shared GD resources by
introducing a user-friendly desktop web system. The existing approach, relying on email
messages and the default GD page, has proven ineffective and cumbersome for users to trace
shared resources. The primary objective of our system is to offer an enhanced and more
convenient method for users to view and manage GD shared resources seamlessly.


1.2 Scope
The scope of our project, the development of the innovative web platform named DUX, aims
to empower users in efficiently managing their shared files. Drawing inspiration from current
Google Drive applications, DUX will serve as a comprehensive platform where all the shared
Google Drive links will be sort according to the category in the DUX platform.
The key functionalities of the project include:
● File Naming:
DUX provides a user-friendly interface for naming files, ensuring clarity and
organization. Users can follow standard naming conventions effortlessly.
● File Tracing:
DUX tackles the challenge of tracking shared files by offering a simple tracing
mechanism. Users can quickly locate and trace files within the platform, eliminating
the complexities of traditional methods.
● File Sorting:
DUX introduces sorting feature, categorizing shared files based on customizable
criteria. This enhances overall accessibility, enabling users to find and manage
resources swiftly.


1.3 Overview
We were tasked to create a web portal that will solve the following problem: the current
approach of sharing Google Drive (GD) resources, which primarily relies on email messages
and the default GD page (https://drive.google.com/), has proven to be ineffective and
cumbersome for users to trace shared resources. To rectify this issue, our project aims to
provide a user-friendly desktop web system that offers an improved and more convenient way
to view and manage GD shared resources. In order to ensure a simpler and more efficient
resource sharing process, our system will also include features that lead users methodically.
Examples of these features include adherence to standard file and folder naming conventions
and the consistent use of created information structures.
